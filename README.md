# Kubernetes
## What is Kubernetes?
Kubernetes, also known as K8s, is an open-source system for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.

It groups containers that make up an application into logical units for easy management and discovery. Kubernetes builds upon 15 years of experience of running production workloads at Google, combined with best-of-breed ideas and practices from the community.

## Why Kubernetes?
### Benefits

- **Flexibility**: Kubernetes is highly configurable. It works with almost any container runtime and any infrastructure, whether itâ€™s a public cloud, private cloud, or on-premises server. 
- **Multi-cloud friendly**: Given its flexibility, Kubernetes is able to host workloads spread across several clouds, making it an excellent tool for companies taking a multi-cloud approach.
- **Increased productivity**: Kubernetes facilitates declarative configuration and allows for GitOps, enabling teams to scale and deploy faster than ever before. 
- **Open source**: Kubernetes is community-led and fully open-source, helping developers and engineers to collaborate and innovate quicker. 
- **Widely-used**: Most developers and engineers know Kubernetes, which helps lower the learning curve for companies new to the platform.

## Features

### Automated rollouts and rollbacks
Kubernetes progressively rolls out changes to your application or its configuration, while monitoring application health to ensure it doesn't kill all your instances at the same time. If something goes wrong, Kubernetes will rollback the change for you. Take advantage of a growing ecosystem of deployment solutions.
### Service discovery and load balancing
No need to modify your application to use an unfamiliar service discovery mechanism. Kubernetes gives Pods their own IP addresses and a single DNS name for a set of Pods, and can load-balance across them.
### Storage orchestration
Automatically mount the storage system of your choice, whether from local storage, a public cloud provider such as GCP or AWS, or a network storage system such as NFS, iSCSI, Gluster, Ceph, Cinder, or Flocker.
### Secret and configuration management
Deploy and update secrets and application configuration without rebuilding your image and without exposing secrets in your stack configuration.
### Automatic bin packing
Automatically places containers based on their resource requirements and other constraints, while not sacrificing availability. Mix critical and best-effort workloads in order to drive up utilization and save even more resources.
### Batch execution
In addition to services, Kubernetes can manage your batch and CI workloads, replacing containers that fail, if desired.
### IPv4/IPv6 dual-stack
Allocation of IPv4 and IPv6 addresses to Pods and Services
### Horizontal scaling
Scale your application up and down with a simple command, with a UI, or automatically based on CPU usage.
### Self-healing
Restarts containers that fail, replaces and reschedules containers when nodes die, kills containers that don't respond to your user-defined health check, and doesn't advertise them to clients until they are ready to serve.
### Designed for extensibility
Add features to your Kubernetes cluster without changing upstream source code.

```
### List available services
`kubectl get service` or `kubectl get svc`
### Create a resource from a file or from stdin
`kubectl create -f file.yml`<br>
*JSON and YAML formats are accepted*
### Display one or many resources
`kubectl get deploy`<br>
`kubectl get pods`<br>
*Prints a table of the most important information about the specified resources. You can filter the list using a label selector and the --selector flag. If the desired resource type is namespaced you will only see results in your current namespace unless you pass --all-namespaces.*
### Show details of a specific resource or group of resources
`kubectl describe deploy deployment-name`<br>
`kubectl describe pod pod-name`<br>
*Print a detailed description of the selected resources, including related resources such as events or controllers. You may select a single object by name, all objects of that type, provide a name prefix, or label selector.*
### Delete resources by file names, stdin, resources and names, or by resources and label selector
`kubectl delete pod pod-name`<br>
*JSON and YAML formats are accepted. Only one type of argument may be specified: file names, resources and names, or resources and label selector*
### Edit a resource from the default editor
`kubectl edit deploy deployment-name`<br>
*The edit command allows you to directly edit any API resource you can retrieve via the command-line tools. It will open the editor defined by your KUBE_EDITOR, or EDITOR environment variables, or fall back to 'vi' for Linux or 'notepad' for Windows. You can edit multiple objects, although changes are applied one at a time. The command accepts file names as well as command-line arguments, although the files you point to must be previously saved versions of resources.*
